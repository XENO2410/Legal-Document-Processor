IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

Civil Appeal No. 1234 of 2024

Petitioner: Ramesh Sharma
Respondent: State of Maharashtra

Legal Provisions:
- Article 21 of the Constitution of India
- Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC)
- Article 226 (WRONGLY MENTIONED)

Summary:
This appeal has been filed by the petitioner, Ramesh Sharma, against the judgment of the Bombay High Court dated 12th January 2023. The petitioner argues that his fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution has been violated due to the prolonged trial in the criminal case.

The court had earlier granted bail to the petitioner under Section 302 of the IPC. However, there is a defect in the case where Article 226 is mentioned incorrectly as a legal provision applicable to the facts of this case. Additionally, the High Court's reference to the accused as 'Ramesh Shukla' in certain parts of the judgment is also incorrect, as the correct name is 'Ramesh Sharma'.

Defects:
1. Incorrect reference to Article 226 of the Constitution instead of Article 32.
2. Wrong name of the petitioner cited as 'Ramesh Shukla' instead of 'Ramesh Sharma' in the High Court judgment.

Prayer:
The petitioner prays that this Hon'ble Court may be pleased to set aside the judgment of the Bombay High Court and direct a re-trial or other suitable remedy.

Dated this 10th day of August 2024

Advocate for the Petitioner
